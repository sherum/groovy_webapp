          <p>The plots tab contains a hierarchy of story themes. Many plots are associated with events. Plots come in two
          basic flavors </p>
          <ol class="bi-list-stars">
          <li>Parent-Child-Grandchild</li>
            <li>Topical</li>
        </ol>
          <h5>Parent-Child-Grandchild</h5>
          <p>The first is Main plot, subplots and side plots. A main plot could be a book, but don't confuse a commercial product with a story's plot
          <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, based on  hearsay, was one book until the publisher chopped it into something people could carry out of the store.</p>
          <p>The main plot is one coherent saga and each subplot is a coherent segment in that saga. Traditional novels use the three act play of
            setting-conflict-resolution. A novel length story could have a main plot, three acts or subplots and each subplot could have it's own set of
            micro-plots. <b>The goal is every child is consistent and supports its parent plot.</b>
          </p>
          <h5>Topical</h5>
          <ul><li><b>Story:</b>
          Breaking a plot into its constituent parts forces the writer to decided what the main plot is then injecting the other components. Story plot should have its
            own subplots with topical plots supporting. Topical plots work well with third-person stories with many characters taking front stage. <i>Star Wars</i>
            has so many moving parts--the Death Star, the rebellion, the Jedi, the Hut all evolving at the same time, but the story is Good vs Evil.
          </li>
            <li><b>Character Arc:</b> I would argue any story over ten thousand words must show character development and a novel-length story without solid character
            evolution will leave readers unsatisfied. Plotting a character arc give you milestones that lay out a story leading
            the protagonist you introduced to something different at the end. Long running stories will evolve many characters. Tracking how characters
          change over time keep details crisp and outcomes focused.</li>
          <li><b>Location</b> Occult and mystery novels use locations like a living thing. Things happen there independent of
            the protagonist and continue to happen. Location plots can be less ominous and would be treated as a grandchild plot. Tracking location plots keeps
          the facts straight. </li>
            <li><b>Event</b> Event plots tend to focus on disasters. The movies <i>Apollo 13</i> and the <i>Titanic</i> have good event plots.
              At the point of disaster, the story changes into something very different. Sometimes maguffins, the hook to reel in the reader. are mistaken for
            plots.  The movie, <i>While You Were Sleeping</i> starts off with the protagonist's object of her fantasy being hospitalized. The location, a transit station,
              makes for better plot type than event as it links the main character to the rest of the story. </li>
